# Multiplication Quiz App

This is a fun and interactive multiplication quiz app that allows users to test their multiplication skills and improve their math proficiency.

## Getting Started

To use the app, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You will see a series of multiplication questions with a input
field to provide the answer and a submit button to submit your answer.

The app is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML provides the structure of the app, the CSS is used to style it, 
and the JavaScript handles the logic of the quiz and displays the result.

The app is designed to be user-friendly and interactive. The layout is clean and visually appealing, and the app provides instant 
feedback to the user on the status of their answers by increasing or decreasing their score.
